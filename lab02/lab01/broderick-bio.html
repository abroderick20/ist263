        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ashley Broderick. I am a junior and a PR and IMT major. When I am home in Hawaii I love to <strong>Commodore 64</strong>swim and hike and when I am at Syracuse I spend a lot of my time either on Tiktok or watching anime!

        </p>
        <h2>School Involvement</h2>
        <p>
            I am interested in writing, web design, and social media. I am involved in University Girl Magazine and PRSSA on campus and have had two internships related to my Newhouse major.

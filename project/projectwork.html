        Ka Hiki Mai Logo <br>
        During my internship in summer of 2021 I worked for a small PR firm. One of the clients I worked with was the the Ka Hiki Mai Scholars Program: a program partnered with Chaminade University that encouraged students at community college through scholarships and advising to continue on to a four-year university. I created a logo for the program on Illustrator following their branding.

    <h3>Social Media</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout various endeavors of mine, I've helped create social media content for platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Here is some of the work I've created on Adobe Photoshop.

        This past summer I joined the Society for Professional Marketing Services, SMPS. The organization is a community of marketing and business development professionals working in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) industry. I assisted the president of the SMPS Hawaii chapter in planning their annual Summer Sipping networking event. Here are some of the social media posts and website headers I created to promote the event.

        Caption: With the summer coming to an end, GH Phipps prepares to say goodbye to departing summer interns. GH Phipps welcomed 26 interns this season, ranging in different departments and backgrounds. From pre- construction to operations to marketing, each intern had diverse tasks specific to their field, giving them on-site experience and setting them apart from future job applicants. As the Fall semester approaches and students embark on their search for next years internships, some of this years interns share their experiences at GH Phipps.

        Caption: Friday Phipps Facts | 1987 Orange Crush Denver Broncos
        
        In 1987, Gerald H. Phipps was featured in the Orange Crush Broncos card set which recognized the early Broncos Ring of Fame members. Sponsored by Orange Crush and KOA Radio, 1.35 million sets were distributed across a three-week period. As the former owner, Phipps was displayed among eight players including Floyd Little, Good Gonsoulin, and Lionel Taylor.

        As per request of an employee, I created a post about a project GH Phipps had worked on at Lakewood High School. The employee was a Lakewood alumni and shared the post to his fellow alumni to engage with.
